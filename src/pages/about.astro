      During my free time, I love indulging in two of my favorite hobbies:
      aviation and American football. You'll often find me gaming on Flight
      Simulator, where I unleash my inner pilot and take to the virtual skies
      for thrilling adventures and breathtaking views. When I'm not soaring
      through the clouds, I'm passionately following the heart-pounding action
      of the NFL. From strategic plays to awe-inspiring athleticism, it's a
      sport that keeps me on the edge of my seat (especially in the 4th Quarter
      when Tom Brady üêê is playing). These recreational pursuits not only bring me
      joy and relaxation but also fuel my creativity and drive in the dynamic
      world of software engineering.
